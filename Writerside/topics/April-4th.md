April 4: Designing Visualizations

### INTRODUCTION

What makes some visualizations effective and others difficult to interpret? Every element that you add to a visualization takes additional "cognitive load" to process. Visual elements that add clutter without adding informative value can make graphs overwhelming, busy, and complicated. On the other hand, attributes like color, size, and position can focus the viewer's attention on the information that matters, but only when those attributes are used strategically. In this lesson, we'll experiment with increasing our "information-to-ink" or "signal-to-noise" ratio in our visualizations.

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Students will be able to:

1) Declutter default graphs

2) Focus attention on the relevant parts of a visualization

3) Create dashboards

### MODEL EXAMPLES OF VISUALIZATIONS

Look through these model examples. Think about the ways that these graphs have been decluttered. Look for alignment and white space. Consider how these graphs focus your attention using color, size/bolding, spacing, text, and Gestalt principles.

### OPTIONAL RESOURCES

This lesson is based on material from a fantastic book called Storytelling with Data by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. The book  is available to read for free through IU Libraries at: [](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15292400)

## Lecture

### How do we determine the message?
Find out **what** you want your message to be.

### Maximize the information to ink ratio
Remove visual clutter, it takes away from the message. Clutter is visual elements that take up space and don't add understanding.
* Use color sparingly, add strategic emphasis (Gestalt Principles)
* Use color consistently and design with colorblind in mind
* Add a "takeaway" title
* Make sure you have whitespace

### Declutter Step-By-Step
1. Remove border and/or heavy lines
2. Remove gridlines
3. Remove data markers
3. Clean axis
4. Choose one *(Dr. Wood recommends keeping y-axis)*
