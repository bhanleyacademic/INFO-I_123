### RESOURCES - MAJOR CONCEPTS

* **Data** - Data can be sensory or acquired through instruments or devices. It can exist in any form, usable or not. In and of itself it has no meaning or significance.

* **5Vs of “Big Data”** – Volume (too much data); Velocity (data is coming too fast); and Variety (data is coming from too many places and in too many formats), Veracity, and Value.

* **Digitization** - The process of converting analog information into the zeros and ones of binary code so computers can handle it.

* **Datafication** – A phenomenon of putting data in a quantified format so that it can be tabulated and analyzed.
* **A bit.** Stands for Binary digit. A bit is the basic unit of computing and has two values (0 and 1). A byte is 8 bits.
Any code that uses just two symbols to represent information is considered binary code. Some examples are Braille and Morse.  Binary code is the way that most computers and computerized devices ultimately send, receive, and store information.
* **Binary notation.** Binary notation is a system of numbers that is expressed in the base-2 numeral system using only the digits 0 and 1.
* **Structured data** are data that can be stored in a table, and every instance in the table has the same structure (that is it has the same set of attributes).
* **Unstructured data** are data where each instance in the data set may have its own internal structure, and thus structure is not necessarily the same in every instance.
* **Metadata** is data describing the structure and properties of the raw data. Metadata are labels that describe things. These labels help people and computer systems find what they’re looking for.
When we describe something, we usually talk about its characteristics or features, also called **properties**.
There are **four types** of metadata: **descriptive** (includes fields that describe data), **technical** (information about technical aspects of data or files), **administrative** (includes fields that deal with intellectual property) and **structural** (info on how data relates to other online resources).
* **Metadata elements** are defined in a **metadata scheme**. Metadata scheme tells you how an element can be used. Dublin Core Element Set (DCES) is a metadata scheme. You use elements of metadata scheme(s) to create **metadata records**.
Metadata can be written in a number of different languages, all of which have their own syntax, and all of which are different than English syntax.
